In this chapter I will discuss the numerical methods that were used in this work.

\section{The Pencil Code}
In our simulations we use the \pencil to numerically integrate the MHD equations.
\section{Powerspectrum}

\begin{itemize}
    \item How was the data analyzed ?

    \item Present the underlying economic model/theory and
        give reasons why it is suitable to answer the given problem.

    \item Present econometric/statistical estimation method and
        give reasons why it is suitable to answer the given problem.

    \item Allows the reader to judge the validity of the study and
        its findings.

    \item Depending on the topic this section can also be split up
        into separate sections.

\end{itemize}
